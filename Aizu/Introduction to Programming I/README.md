Notes:

Branch or Condition:
====================
Small, Large, or Equal - too simple
Range - too simple
Sorting Three Numbers - simple , use vector stl
Circle in a Rectangle - pay attention to the constraint condition, and if iit occurs after cout make sure to return 0; otherwise next condition will take place. Tryi it.


Repetitive Processing:
======================
Print Many Hello World - baby problem
Print Test Cases - this will teach how to stop taking input while certain value appears. 
Swapping Two Numbers - Take input till both of the number is 0. If only one is 0 proceeed. Try it.

Computation:
=============
A / B Problem -> Learn how to set prcecision, Another take way from this problem is that if you divide two integer value and store the result in a double then you will not get double value as expected... before dividing you have to convert one of the number as double. 

Circle -> Input is a REAL number, so take it as double! For pi value, we can use  M_PI from math class or we can take the value of acos(-1) which returns pi value. 


Simple Calculator -> Pay attention input consists of multiple datasets.

Min, Max and Sum -> Sum should hold big numbers, so use long long. Allowed min and max can be found by -INT_Max, INT_Max . This will teach how to find min and max. If you are using vector/array you can use *min_element(start, end), *max_element(start, end).  Try it. 


Structured Program I:
=====================
Print a Rectangle -> baby problem.
Print a Frame -> First complete the 'Print a Rectangle' problem and then modify it to make it frame. 'Continue' keyword skip the rest of code of current iteration and move to next iteration. Try it.
Print a Chessboard -> Very interesting.. Try it. 


Array:
======
Reversing Numbers - Easy one, used stack to solve it.


Structured Program II:
======================
How many ways -> Use three loop to sum the target value. Try this. 
Spreadsheet -> Matrix row and column summation. Try this implementation. 

Character:
==========
Toggling Cases -> Try to memorize the ascii value for 'a' and 'A'. Casting a char into int will return the ascii value of that character. Try this.
Sum of Numbers -> Take the entire input as string and then take each character of that string and convert it to int and add it with previous summation. Try this. 
Counting Characters - > Make the upper case letter to lower case, avoid processing special character. Must Try it.
